<strong>Structured Independent Learning (SIL)</strong> is the name that was coined to describe the learning environment that I used for over twenty years with my high school physics, chemistry and mathematics students. The basic idea is that it shifts ones teaching practice from being a “sage on the stage” to being a “guide on the side.”

To learn more about SIL and how I came to develop this approach I suggest you begin by reading the <a href='/docs/Structured%20Independent%20Learning/Structured%20Independent%20Learning.pdf' target="newWindow">SIL student handout</a>. The handout is a short document that will give you a flavour of the practice. For those who want something more in depth you can read the <a href='/docs/Structured%20Independent%20Learning/SIL%20description.pdf' target="newWindow">SIL description</a>. This document describes in greater detail what SIL looks like on a day-to-day basis and provides tips on how to implement an independent approach in your teaching practice.
