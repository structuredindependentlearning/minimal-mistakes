<p>For all of the lessons there will be references made to the Physics text by Pearson. The Pearson text book was designed specifically for the physics curriculum. It is an excellent resource and should be referred to often by you the student. For this lesson refer to page 6.</p>
<h1 id="introduction-to-physics-20">Introduction to Physics 20</h1>
<p>The majority of Physics 20 involves the classic work that every physicist has been trained in since the time of Galileo, namely the study of motion. You will learn that physics involves two basic ideas:</p>
<p>1. The ability to describe the physical universe using numbers and equations. (Of course, word descriptions are also used, but the <strong>language</strong> of physics is mathematics.)</p>
<p>2. The physical universe can be understood in terms of some simple laws or principles from which all kinds of phenomena can be described, predicted and understood.</p>
<p>There are three branches of the study of motion:</p>
<p><strong>Kinematics</strong> is the branch of physics that deals with the <em>description</em> of the motion of objects without referring to any forces or agents which may cause the motion.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamics</strong> is the branch of physics which attempts to explain the <em>causes</em> for the motion that kinematics describes.</p>
<p><strong>Energetics</strong> is the branch of physics that deals with the transformation of one kind of energy into another form of energy.</p>
<h1 id="position-distance-and-time">Position, Distance and Time</h1>
<p><strong>Distance</strong> – is the linear space between two points.</p>
<p>The symbol for distance is (d) and the units are: m, cm, km, mm, light years, etc. The standard unit for distance is the meter (m).</p>
<p><strong>Position</strong> – for an accurate description of any motion it is necessary to know where an object is relative to a point of reference. For example, is 1 block away from the front doors of . In this case the <strong>reference point</strong> is the front doors of EMHS. Motion or a change in position is always measured relative to some reference point which is referred to as the <strong>origin</strong>. (See Pearson pages 13 and 14 for a discussion on <strong>frames of reference</strong>.)</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong> – is the interval between two events. The symbol for time is (t) and the units are: s (seconds), min (minutes), h (hours), a (years). The standard unit for time is the second (s).</p>
<h1 id="speed"><br />
Speed</h1>
<p>There are two basic types of motion:</p>
<p><em>Uniform motion</em> – motion which involves constant speed or constant velocity.</p>
<p><em>Non-uniform motion</em> – motion which involves a change in speed or velocity.</p>
<p><strong>Speed</strong> (v) is defined as the rate at which an object is moving.</p>
<p>where v speed (m/s, cm/s, km/h, etc.)</p>
<p>Δd change in distance (m, cm, mm, km, etc.)</p>
<p>Δt change in time (s, min, h, a, etc.)</p>
<p>There are three ways that the term “speed” is used:</p>
<h2 id="uniform-speed">Uniform Speed</h2>
<p>Uniform speed refers to speed that remains unchanged and constant.</p>
<h2 id="average-speed">Average Speed</h2>
<p>While variations in the actual speed may occur, we can calculate an average speed for the time interval.</p>
<h2 id="instantaneous-speed">Instantaneous Speed</h2>
<p>Instantaneous speed is the speed of an object at a given <em>instant</em> in time.</p>
<h3 id="example-1" class="Example"><br />
Example 1</h3>
<p>An object travels 510 km in 4.0 h. What was the average speed of the object?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>= <strong>127.5 km/h</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="example-2" class="Example">Example 2</h3>
<p>An object travels 6.5 km in 31 minutes. What was the average speed in m/s?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>= <strong>3.4 m/s</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>for conversions remember</p>
<p>1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds</p>
<p>1 minute = 60 seconds</p>
<p>You may be asked to solve for variables other than average speed. Such questions will involve manipulating formulas.</p>
<h3 id="example-3" class="Example">Example 3</h3>
<p>An object travelling at 60 km/h will travel how far in a 20 minute time interval?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(manipulate the formula)</p>
<p>Δd = v<sub>ave</sub> Δt = 60 km/h x 0.33 h = <strong>20 km</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="example-4" class="Example">Example 4</h3>
<p>How much time is required for an object travelling at 50 m/s to travel a distance of 6.0 km?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(manipulate the formula)</p>
<p>= <strong>1.2 x 10<sup>2</sup> s</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="example-5" class="Example"><br />
Example 5</h3>
<p>Convert 40.0 km/h into m/s.</p>
<p>(The difficulty in this conversion is that two factors are being changed at the same time. The method shown below uses unit analysis to eliminate the original units and replacing them with the desired unit.)</p>
<p><em>40.0 <del>km</del></em> x <em>1000 m</em> x <em>1 <del>h</del></em> = <strong>11.1 m/s</strong></p>
<p>1 <del>h</del> 1 <del>km</del> 3600 s</p>
<p>(A far simpler way to convert km/h to m/s or m/s to km/h is to remember the number <strong>3.6</strong> which comes from 3600/1000. To convert km/h to m/s divide by 3.6. To convert from m/s to km/h multiply by 3.6)</p>
<h3 id="example-6" class="Example">Example 6</h3>
<p>An airplane travels 1800 km at a speed of 1000 km/h. It then encounters a headwind that slows the plane to 850 km/h for the next 2300 km. What was the plane’s average speed?</p>
<p>(Some people may feel inclined to just average 850 km/h and 1000 km/h directly. However, since the speeds apply to different distances and times, they cannot be averaged directly.)</p>
<p>For average speed we need the total time and the total distance:</p>
<p>= 1.8 h = 2.71 h</p>
<p>Δt = 1.8 h + 2.71 h = 4.51h</p>
<p>Δd = 1800 km + 2300 km = 4100 km</p>
<p>= <strong>910 km/h</strong></p>

More difficult problems</h1>
<p>Some problems are not easy, in fact they can be quite difficult. In the following example there are two unknowns that must be solved for. One equation is sufficient to calculate one unknown. For two unknowns, two equations are required.</p>
<h3 id="example-7" class="Example">Example 7</h3>
<p>Two roller bladers, A and B, are having a race. B gives A a head start of 5.0 s. Each roller blader moves with a constant speed in the same direction. If A travels at 5.0 m/s and B travels at 7.5 m/s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. How long will it take for B to catch A?</p>
<p>b. At what position will B catch up with A?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both A and B will skate a distance x from the origin.</p>
<p>If we call the time that A travels t</p>
<p>Δt<sub>A</sub> = t</p>
<p>then roller blader B will be moving for 5.0 s less. Therefore,</p>
<p>Δt<sub>B</sub> = t – 5.0</p>
<p>To calculate the position we substitute t = 15 s into either equation 1 or 2.</p>
<p>x = 5.0 t</p>
<p>x = 5.0 (15 s)</p>
<p>x = <strong>75 m</strong></p>
<p>To summarise, B will catch A 10 s after A started at a distance of 75 m from the origin.</p>
